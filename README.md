# CAPTCHA-Recognition-Model

CAPTCHA Recognition Models Explanation:

The attached Python codes are for CAPTCHA recognition modes that use either CNN or RESNET to decode images of CAPTCHAs. Below is a simplified breakdown of their functionalities:

<ins>CNN Model</ins>

<strong>Data Preparation:</strong>

Load CAPTCHA images from a specified directory.
Preprocess the images to a standardized format, normalize pixel values, and perform one-hot encoding on the text labels.

<strong>Model Training:</strong>

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to recognize and classify the characters in CAPTCHA images.

<strong>Evaluation:</strong>

Evaluate the trained model on a test set and print metrics such as accuracy.
Create visualizations to compare the performance of the model across different epochs.
Confusion Matrices:
Generate confusion matrices for the model, illustrating its performance on classifying each character in the CAPTCHAs.

<strong>Model Saving:</strong>

Save the trained CNN model to a file for future use in CAPTCHA decoding tasks.

<strong>Interacting with the Code: For future users:</strong>

Adjust the preprocessing steps according to the specific CAPTCHA image characteristics.
Ensure the dataset path and file names match your setup.
Run the code step by step or in its entirety to train and evaluate the model.
Use the saved CNN model for making predictions on new CAPTCHA images.
This explanation aligns with the CAPTCHA recognition code and provides a clear guide for users to understand and interact with the model. If you need any more modifications or have other questions, feel free to ask!
