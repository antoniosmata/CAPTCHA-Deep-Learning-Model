# CAPTCHA-Recognition-Model
<ins>Summary</ins>

The attached Python codes are for CAPTCHA recognition modes that use either CNN or ResNet to decode images of CAPTCHAs. Below is a simplified breakdown of their functionalities:

<strong>Data Preparation:</strong>

Load CAPTCHA images from a specified directory.
Preprocess the images to a standardized format, normalize pixel values, and perform one-hot encoding on the text labels.

<strong>Model Architecture:</strong>

A CNN or ResNet model is built with layers designed for feature extraction and classification.
The model includes convolutional layers, max pooling, a flattening step, dense layers, and dropout for regularization.
The output layer is structured to predict multiple characters, each with a set of possible classes.


<strong>Training Process:</strong>

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Training is conducted over 100 epochs with validation data to monitor performance.

<strong>Evaluation:</strong>

The trained model is evaluated on a test set and prints metrics such as accuracy.

<strong>Model Saving:</strong>

Save the trained CNN or ResNet model to a file for future use in CAPTCHA decoding tasks.

<strong>Interacting with the code for future users:</strong>

•	Adjust the preprocessing steps according to the specific CAPTCHA image characteristics.

•	Ensure the dataset path and file names match your setup.

•	Run the code step by step or in its entirety to train and evaluate the model.

•	Use the saved CNN or ResNet model for making predictions on new CAPTCHA images.
